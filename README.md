# Algorithm visualization

This project was created to visualize different search algorithms in a maze to illustrate how they work.
I will try to implement a new algorithm whenever I have time.<br>
Currently implemented are:

* Breadth First Search (unweighted and gurantees the shortest path)

* Depth First Search (unweighted and does not gurantee the shortest path)

* Dijkstra`s Algorithm (weighted and gurantees the shortest path)
