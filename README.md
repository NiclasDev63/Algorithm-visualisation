# Algorithm visualization

This project was created to visualize different search algorithms in a maze to illustrate how they work.
I will try to implement a new algorithm whenever I have time.<br>
Currently implemented are:

* Breadth First Search (**unweighted** and **gurantees** the shortest path)

* Depth First Search (**unweighted** and **does not gurantee** the shortest path)

* Dijkstra`s Algorithm (**weighted** and **gurantees** the shortest path)
